; ToggleKey specifies the virtual-key codes for the keys that can toggle the feature.
; Multiple keys can be specified, separated by commas.
; Each key should be in hexadecimal format (e.g., 0x72 for F3, 0x73 for F4).
; The '0x' prefix is optional; both "0x72" and "72" are accepted and interpreted as hex.
; If no valid keys are provided, defaults to 0x72 (F3).
; Refer to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes for a list of codes.
; Example: ToggleKey = 0x72,0x73  ; This sets F3 and F4 as toggle keys.
ToggleKey = 0x72
