[Settings]
; ToggleKey specifies the virtual-key codes for the keys that can toggle between first-person
; and third-person views. Multiple keys can be specified, separated by commas.
; Each key should be in hexadecimal format (e.g., 0x72 for F3, 0x73 for F4).
; The '0x' prefix is optional; both "0x72" and "72" are accepted and interpreted as hex.
;
; If set to empty (ToggleKey = ), no toggle keys will be monitored.
; Default: F3 key (0x72)
;
; Refer to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes for a list of codes.
; Example: ToggleKey = 0x72,0x73  ; This sets F3 and F4 as toggle keys.
ToggleKey = 0x72

; FPVKey specifies keys that will always switch to first-person view (value 0).
; These keys will never toggle - they only set the view to first-person.
; Format is the same as ToggleKey (comma-separated hex values).
;
; If set to empty (FPVKey = ), no first-person view keys will be monitored.
;
; Example: FPVKey = 0x56,0x57  ; This sets V and W as first-person view keys
FPVKey =

; TPVKey specifies keys that will always switch to third-person view (value 1)
; These keys will never toggle - they only set the view to third-person
; Format is the same as ToggleKey (comma-separated hex values)
;
; If set to empty (TPVKey = ), no third-person view keys will be monitored.
; Default: No keys assigned (empty)
;
; Example: TPVKey = 0x54,0x55  ; This sets T and U as third-person view keys
TPVKey =

; LogLevel specifies the logging level: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
; Default: INFO (recommended for regular use, use DEBUG for troubleshooting)
LogLevel = INFO

; ===== OPTIONAL FEATURES =====

; EnableOverlayFeature controls whether the overlay detection system is active.
; When enabled (true), the mod will:
; - Automatically switch to FPV when menus/dialogs open
; - Restore the previous view when menus/dialogs close
; - Filter scroll wheel input to prevent camera movement during overlays
;
; Set to false to disable this feature entirely (may save some system resources)
; Default: true
EnableOverlayFeature = true

; TpvFovDegrees sets the field of view for third-person mode in degrees.
; When specified, the mod will override the game's default TPV FOV.
; Set to an empty value to disable this feature.
;
; Valid range: Any positive value up to 180 degrees
; Common values: 60-90 degrees (default game FOV is typically around 68.75)
; Example: TpvFovDegrees = 68.75
;
; Leave empty or comment out to disable FOV modification:
TpvFovDegrees =

; SPECIAL CONFIGURATION:
; If ALL key settings (ToggleKey, FPVKey, and TPVKey) are set to empty,
; the mod will still load but no hotkeys will be monitored.
; This effectively disables all hotkey functionality while keeping the
; optional features (overlay detection, FOV override) active if enabled.
;
; Example configuration for completely disabling all hotkeys:
; ToggleKey =
; FPVKey =
; TPVKey =
