[Settings]
; ToggleKey specifies the virtual-key codes for the keys that can toggle between first-person
; and third-person views. Multiple keys can be specified, separated by commas.
; Each key should be in hexadecimal format (e.g., 0x72 for F3, 0x73 for F4).
; The '0x' prefix is optional; both "0x72" and "72" are accepted and interpreted as hex.
;
; If set to empty (ToggleKey = ), no toggle keys will be monitored.
; Default: F3 key (0x72)
;
; Refer to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes for a list of codes.
; Example: ToggleKey = 0x72,0x73  ; This sets F3 and F4 as toggle keys.
ToggleKey = 0x72

; FPVKey specifies keys that will always switch to first-person view (value 0).
; These keys will never toggle - they only set the view to first-person.
; Format is the same as ToggleKey (comma-separated hex values).
;
; If set to empty (FPVKey = ), no first-person view keys will be monitored.
;
; Example: FPVKey = 0x56,0x57  ; This sets V and W as first-person view keys
FPVKey =

; TPVKey specifies keys that will always switch to third-person view (value 1)
; These keys will never toggle - they only set the view to third-person
; Format is the same as ToggleKey (comma-separated hex values)
;
; If set to empty (TPVKey = ), no third-person view keys will be monitored.
; Default: No keys assigned (empty)
;
; Example: TPVKey = 0x54,0x55  ; This sets T and U as third-person view keys
TPVKey =

; LogLevel specifies the logging level: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
; Default: INFO (recommended for regular use, use DEBUG for troubleshooting)
LogLevel = INFO

; ===== OPTIONAL FEATURES =====

; EnableOverlayFeature controls whether the overlay detection system is active.
; When enabled (true), the mod will:
; - Automatically switch to FPV when menus/dialogs open
; - Restore the previous view when menus/dialogs close
; - Filter scroll wheel input to prevent camera movement during overlays
;
; Set to false to disable this feature entirely (may save some system resources)
; Default: true
EnableOverlayFeature = true

; HoldKeyToScroll specifies a key that, when held down, enables mouse wheel scrolling
; to adjust camera distance. When this feature is enabled, scrolling will be disabled
; by default, and only enabled while holding the specified key.
;
; If set to empty, scrolling behavior will follow the overlay detection system
; (scrolling enabled when no overlay is active, disabled during overlays).
;
; Common choices:
; - Left Shift: 0x10
; - Left Control: 0x11
; - Left Alt: 0x12
; - Space: 0x20
;
; Example: HoldKeyToScroll = 0x10  ; Left Shift key
HoldKeyToScroll =

; TpvFovDegrees sets the field of view for third-person mode in degrees.
; When specified, the mod will override the game's default TPV FOV.
; Set to an empty value to disable this feature.
;
; Valid range: Any positive value up to 180 degrees
; Common values: 60-90 degrees (default game FOV is typically around 68.75)
; Example: TpvFovDegrees = 68.75
;
; Leave empty or comment out to disable FOV modification:
TpvFovDegrees =

; SPECIAL CONFIGURATION:
; If ALL key settings (ToggleKey, FPVKey, and TPVKey) are set to empty,
; the mod will still load but no hotkeys will be monitored.
; This effectively disables all hotkey functionality while keeping the
; optional features (overlay detection, FOV override) active if enabled.
;
; Example configuration for completely disabling all hotkeys:
; ToggleKey =
; FPVKey =
; TPVKey =

; EXPERIMENTAL - MISALIGNED RAYCAST WARNING
; --- Third-Person Camera Offset ---
; Adjust the camera's position relative to the player character in TPV.
; Offsets are applied based on the direction the CAMERA is currently facing.
; Positive X moves camera Right, Negative X moves Left.
; Positive Y moves camera Forward (closer), Negative Y moves Backward (further away).
; Positive Z moves camera Up, Negative Z moves Down.
;
; NOTE: Using camera offsets will cause the crosshair/raycast to be misaligned with the camera.
; The game's interaction system will still use the original camera position for determining
; what you're pointing at, which means the crosshair may not align with what you're targeting.

; TpvOffsetX: Horizontal offset. (Default: 0.0)
; Example: TpvOffsetX = 0.5  ; Camera shifted slightly to the right shoulder
; Example: TpvOffsetX = -0.5 ; Camera shifted slightly to the left shoulder
TpvOffsetX = 0.0

; TpvOffsetY: Forward/Backward offset. (Default: 0.0 = Game Default Distance)
; NOTE: Positive values move CLOSER. Negative values move FURTHER AWAY.
; Example: TpvOffsetY = -1.5 ; Camera pushed further back from the player
; Example: TpvOffsetY = 0.5  ; Camera moved closer to the player
TpvOffsetY = 0.0

; TpvOffsetZ: Vertical offset. (Default: 0.0)
; Example: TpvOffsetZ = 0.1 ; Camera raised slightly higher
TpvOffsetZ = 0.0

; ===== CAMERA SENSITIVITY SETTINGS =====
[CameraSensitivity]
; Vertical (pitch) sensitivity multiplier
; Lower values reduce vertical (Up/Down) sensitivity (0.0-2.0)
; Example: 0.4 (40% of sensitivity)
; Default: 1.0 (100% - no change)
PitchSensitivity = 1.0

; Horizontal (yaw) sensitivity multiplier
; Lower values reduce horizontal (Left/Right) sensitivity (0.0-2.0)
; Default: 1.0 (100% - no change)
YawSensitivity = 1.0

; ===== CAMERA PROFILES SYSTEM =====
[CameraProfiles]
; Enable the camera profile system (true/false)
; When enabled, this allows real-time adjustment of camera position
; and saving/loading different camera profiles
Enable = false

; Step size for camera position adjustments
; Smaller values (e.g., 0.01) allow finer control, larger values (e.g., 0.1) allow faster adjustments
AdjustmentStep = 0.01

; === KEY BINDINGS FOR CAMERA PROFILES ===
; All keys are specified in hex format (with optional 0x prefix)

; === TRANSITION SETTINGS ===
; Smoothstep Interpolation: f(x) = x² × (3 - 2x)
