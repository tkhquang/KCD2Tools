## Experimental Overlay Detection and Project Structure Improvements

### Added
- [EXPERIMENTAL] Automatic view management for game menus and overlays
- Automatically switch to first-person view when menus open
- Preserve camera state during menu interactions

### Project Structure
- Moved all source and header files to the `src/` folder
- Updated Makefile and GitHub Actions to use the new structure
- Adjusted version updater script to read `src/version.h`
- Updated README and build instructions

### Limitations
- Pre-release experimental feature
- May not work perfectly with all game interactions
- Relies on specific game memory patterns that could change with updates
