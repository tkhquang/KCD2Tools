[size=5]Known Issues and Limitations[/size]
[list]
[*] The "PickableItem" class doesn't contain all pickable items in the game (for example, torches may not be highlighted)
[*] Some items might be highlighted but still can't be picked up, and some pickable items might not be highlighted
[*] Performance may decrease if highlighting many objects at once in dense areas
[/list]

[size=5]Note[/size]
I don't have experience with creating particle effects, so the current highlight beacons are adapted from existing game resources with some tweaks. If anyone has better particle effect ideas or expertise with creating custom particles for KCD II, please contact me - I'd be happy to collaborate on improving the visual effects in this mod!
