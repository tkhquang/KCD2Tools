[h2]Known Issues and Limitations[/h2]
[list]
[*]The "PickableItem" class doesn't contain all pickable items in the game (for example, torches may not be highlighted)
[*]Some items might be highlighted but still can't be picked up, and some pickable items might not be highlighted
[*]Performance may decrease if highlighting many objects at once in dense areas
[*]This is an early version that needs further testing - please report any issues you encounter
[/list]

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
This mod should be compatible with most other KCD II mods as it doesn't modify any core game systems, only adds visual effects to existing entities.

[h2]Localization[/h2]
The mod currently supports the following languages:
[list]
[*]English
[*]Italian
[/list]

[h2]Note[/h2]
I don't have experience with creating particle effects, so the current highlight beacons are adapted from existing game resources with some tweaks. If anyone has better particle effect ideas or expertise with creating custom particles for KCD II, please contact me - I'd be happy to collaborate on improving the visual effects in this mod!
