[h2]‚ö†Ô∏è CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è[/h2]
[b]You can customize the mod by creating a configuration file in one of these locations:[/b]

1. Create a folder in one of these locations:
   [list]
   [*][b]C:\KCD2Mods\LootBeacon\[/b]
   [*][b]D:\KCD2Mods\LootBeacon\[/b]

3. Copy the following configuration into the mod.cfg file:
[code]
-- #####################################

-- IMPORTANT FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR USERS:
-- 1. DO NOT add or remove spaces in parameter assignments
-- 2. Always use the EXACT format: parameter =value
--    (space after equals sign, NO space before)
-- 3. Editing the values is fine, but keep the format intact

-- Examples:
--   CORRECT:   loot_beacon_set_detection_radius =20.0
--   INCORRECT: loot_beacon_set_detection_radius=20.0  (missing space after =)
--   INCORRECT: loot_beacon_set_detection_radius = 20.0 (extra space before value)

-- Detection radius in meters
loot_beacon_set_detection_radius =15.0

-- Particle effect for items (available colors: red, green, blue)
loot_beacon_set_item_particle_effect_path ="loot_beacon.pillar_red"

-- Particle effect for human corpses
loot_beacon_set_human_corpse_particle_effect_path ="loot_beacon.pillar_green"

-- Particle effect for animal corpses
loot_beacon_set_animal_corpse_particle_effect_path ="loot_beacon.pillar_blue"

-- Highlight duration in seconds
loot_beacon_set_highlight_duration =5.0

-- Show on-screen messages (1=on, 0=off)
loot_beacon_set_show_message =1

-- Log level (1=Debug, 2=Info, 3=Warning, 4=Error)
loot_beacon_set_log_level =2

-- Enable/disable highlighting for different types (1=on, 0=off)
loot_beacon_set_highlight_items =1      -- Pickable items
loot_beacon_set_highlight_corpses =1    -- Human corpses
loot_beacon_set_highlight_animals =1    -- Animal corpses

-- Key binding for highlight activation (F4 is default)
loot_beacon_set_key_binding =f4

[/code]

4. Modify the values as you wish, following these rules:
   [list]
   [*]Always use [b]= value[/b] (space after equals sign)
   [*]No spaces before the value
   [*]Use whole numbers for on/off settings (1 or 0)
   [*]Use decimal numbers for radius and duration
   [/list]

[h2]Configuration Options[/h2]
You can modify the mod's behavior using console commands or by creating a configuration file:

Key Configuration:
[code]
loot_beacon_set_key_binding =f4    # Change F4 to any key you prefer
[/code]

Detection Settings:
[code]
loot_beacon_set_detection_radius =15.0    # Detection radius in meters
loot_beacon_set_highlight_duration =5.0   # Duration of highlight effect in seconds
loot_beacon_set_show_message =1           # Show on-screen messages (1=on, 0=off)
[/code]

Object Type Settings (1=on, 0=off):
[code]
loot_beacon_set_highlight_items =1        # Highlight pickable items

loot_beacon_set_highlight_animals =1      # Highlight animal carcasses
[/code]

Particle Effect Colors:
[code]
loot_beacon_set_item_particle_effect_path ="loot_beacon.pillar_red"          # Red beacon for items
loot_beacon_set_human_corpse_particle_effect_path ="loot_beacon.pillar_green"  # Green beacon for human corpses
loot_beacon_set_animal_corpse_particle_effect_path ="loot_beacon.pillar_blue"  # Blue beacon for animal carcasses
[/code]

[h2]Known Issues and Limitations[/h2]
[list]
[*]The "PickableItem" class doesn't contain all pickable items in the game (for example, torches may not be highlighted)
[*]Some items might be highlighted but still can't be picked up, and some pickable items might not be highlighted
[*]Performance may decrease if highlighting many objects at once in dense areas
[*]This is an early version that needs further testing - please report any issues you encounter
[/list]

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
This mod should be compatible with most other KCD II mods as it doesn't modify any core game systems, only adds visual effects to existing entities.

[h2]Localization[/h2]
The mod currently supports the following languages:
[list]
[*]English
[*]Italian
[/list]

[h2]Note[/h2]
I don't have experience with creating particle effects, so the current highlight beacons are adapted from existing game resources with some tweaks. If anyone has better particle effect ideas or expertise with creating custom particles for KCD II, please contact me - I'd be happy to collaborate on improving the visual effects in this mod!
