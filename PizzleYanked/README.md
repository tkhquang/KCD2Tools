# Pizzle Yanked

```bbcode
[size=6]Game Over? Nah, Pizzle Yanked! (Alternate Death Text)[/size]

[size=5]Description[/size]
Tired of the same old depressing "Game Over" screen? Let's be honest — it doesn't really capture the [i]essence[/i] of your medieval misfortunes.

This mod replaces the boring [b]"Game Over"[/b] text with the much more historically significant and spiritually accurate phrase:
[size=5][b]"Pizzle Yanked"[/b][/size]
Because when you take a sword to the chest or get jumped by three drunk peasants behind the tavern, it ain't just your health bar that's gone — it's your dignity too.

This is a [i]completely cosmetic[/i], lore-breaking, and deeply unnecessary mod. Which makes it perfect.

[size=5]Features[/size]
[list]
[*] Replaces the “Game Over” screen text with: [b]"Pizzle Yanked"[/b]
[*] 100% immersion-breaking. 200% funnier.
[*] Compatible with all causes of death, including heroic fails and peasant brawls
[*] Localization file override (English only for now — help me translate “Pizzle Yanked” into medieval French and we’ll talk)
[*] Folder name: [code]alt_death_text_pizzle_yanked[/code]
[/list]

[i]Note:[/i] This mod currently [b]only affects English localization[/b]. I don’t know what “Pizzle Yanked” should look like in other languages — if you have suggestions (or regional slang just as dumb), send them my way and I’ll add them!
